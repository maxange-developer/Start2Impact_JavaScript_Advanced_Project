# Overview üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è

This is my third project for Start2Impact University. The project involved the creation of a website, using JavaScript, that would allow to get information on the quality of life of a city.

The site's home screen is made up of three elements (the title, an input and a button) and a blurred background.

Typing the name of a city takes you to the page with the details of the city (the name, the image, a short description and the scores)

As regards the javascript code I used lodash and axios for managing api calls, and webpack as module bundler.

I created all html elements via javascript and used css for styling directly within webpack.

The data used to create the site are those of [Teleport API](https://developers.teleport.org/api/)
